Abstract: Convolutional neural networks, mainly used for image recognition, have been proposed as a powerful tool for time series classification. To understand how CNNs are able to perform time series classification, we use topological data analysis methods on data sets consisting of the filter weights of CNNs trained on financial data. Using methods established in previous research, we conduct several experiments on these point clouds, obtaining persistence diagrams and comparing them for different volatility of underlying data, different layers of a CNN, and for different types of deep neural networks. We analyze persistent homology using persistence diagrams, Wasserstein distance, and the Mapper algorithm.
